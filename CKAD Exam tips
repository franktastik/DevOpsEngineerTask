I practiced the mock exams several times on KodeKloud. I practiced them until you are able to get 100% and finish it in time.

After the course, I start the first killer.sh simulation and answered all the questions. 
The first time I could not answer them all and needed more time than the stated two hours.

I studied the solutions from Killer.sh and reiterated the topics in the Udemy course. 

Keep on practicing the online Github questions.

A couple of days before the exam, start the second killer.sh simulation. 
Both sessions give you the same questions. I practiced it until I was able to solve all the questions within two hours.
